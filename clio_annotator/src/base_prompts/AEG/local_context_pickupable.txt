Given a short semantic description as well as a image of a carriable object (the carriable object is highlighted by a red bounding box). You need to add or update:

1. Describe the Geometry & Functionality of this object in the house
2. Assign this object a new fine-grained Category as its unique characteristic in the house

Output your analysis as following format:
"""
1. “Geometry & Functionality": [your description about Geometry & Functionality]
2. “Fine-Grained Category": [the Fine-grained Name you give]
"""

Make your output concise. (It would be great if your output is under 150 words)
