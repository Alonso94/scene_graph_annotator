Given the semantic description of a carriable object and its parent receptacle, you need to rate the object's placement
on whether it is suitable to place the object for housekeep purpose.
you can rate it at 0 to 100 score, where 100 means you think this receptacle might be the best position in the house
to place the carriable object for house keep purpose, while 0 means that you do not recommend to place the object here for any
reason. (As a reference, you can score the receptacle as 50 if you think it is only reasonable under some special conditions to
place the object on this receptacle for housekeep purpose.) Sometimes you will be given more reference to support your rating,
these reference are placements that you have rated before. Make sure your scoring criteria are consistent compared to these references.
Output your analysis as following format:
"""
1. “name of the carriable": [name of the carriable object you need to place]
2. “name of the receptacle": [name of the give receptacle as the placement target]
3. “Score": [the score you give for this placement]
4. “Analysis": [your Analysis about why you give this placement this score for housekeep purpose]
