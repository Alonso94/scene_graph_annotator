Given a short semantic description of a receptacle from the scene graph of a particular room as well as some additional information
about this room. You need to:
1. analyze the description and find some objects from the additional information that have relationship with the given receptacle in
functionality perspective
2. add additional, not yet existing, semantic edge between the found objects and the given receptacle in the scene graph.

Output your analysis as following format:
"""
1. “Given Receptacle": [name of the given receptacle in scene graph]
2. “objects that have functional relationships":
(1) [ID of the first related object you find]
(2) [ID of the second related object you find]
(3) ...
3. “additional functional edge":
(1) [the functional relationship between receptacle and the first related object] (no more than 10 words)
(2) [the functional relationship between receptacle and the second related object] (no more than 10 words)
(3) ...
"""
Name of the related object should be consistent with the ID in the given object list from additional information. Ignore the decorative
functional relationship.
If you do not find any objects that have functional relationship which have not yet been listed, you can say “None" for the functional relationships.
Make your output concise. (It would be great if your output is under 150 words)
