1. Describe the geometry and position of this receptacle in the house
2. Describe the relationship between this receptacle and its surrounding objects, including objects it is supporting. (ignore the decorative objects)
3. Based on your previous description, analyze the unique usage of this object as a receptacle and describe some possible items that can be placed on this receptacle.

Output your analysis as following format:
"""

2. “Relationship": [your description about Relationships]
3. “Unique Usage": [your analysis for Unique Usage ]
4. “Fine-Grained Category": [the Fine-grained Name you give]
"""

Make your output concise. (It would be great if your output is under 150 words)
